                <p className="mb-[10px]">
                  Walmart Vriddhi is a supplier development program launched in
                  2019 with a commitment to empower 50,000 MSMEs in India over
                  five years. In its first phase, the program surpassed that
                  goal by training over 60,000 MSMEs and has played a catalytic
                  role in supporting small businesses with growth opportunities
                  to reach new national and international markets.

                  The program is tailored to help MSMEs modernize, scale and
                  meet their national, and (for some) international ambitions.
                  It underscores Walmart&apos;s focus to help unlock
                  India&apos;s entrepreneurial capacity and enable MSMEs to
                  thrive in the market. The program offers MSMEs access to
                  free-of-cost training, mentoring, and business advice.

                  By using digital tools to train business leaders on crucial
                  aspects of business management such as finance, marketing,
                  workforce management, and environmental sustainability, we
                  empower entrepreneurs to establish successful and sustainable
                  business models while contributing to employment opportunities
                  in local communities.

                  Established in 2017, the Ideas to Impact (i2i) Foundation
                  began its journey with a clear mission: to bridge the gap
                  between strategy and impact. Drawing on the co- founders&apos;
                  expertise in social advisory, i2i Foundation developed a
                  distinctive model that integrates 360° advisory services with
                  hands-on implementation to create inclusive and scalable
                  development solutions. Its credentials to enable small
                  businesses through Walmart Vriddhi are rooted in this
                  expertise. The Foundation also works extensively with
                  governments, and a number of national and international
                  partners and is committed to designing, piloting, and
                  institutionalizing innovative solutions through
                  multi-stakeholder collaboration.
